	<p>In this suitcase you can encounter traces from four groups of worlds, all related to migration, but different: The eclectic and neo-colonial world of Raymond Roussel's poem "Nouvelles Impressions d'Afrique," photos and recollections of persons in Georgia whose relatives migrated to Greece, made in 2015 by a young migrant from Georgia, videos made collaboratively with migrants to Greece from 5 different nationalities, and an excerpt from a short story describing a homeless dervish living in Athens at the turn of the 20th century. The suitcase itself is an evolving memory machine migrating between venues from Canada to Europe, and the memories that it will trace are your own words and interactions with it. You can visit the worlds, visit the traces left by visitors and also weave and shape these memories by entering your texts.

	  In the <a href="http://192.168.77.1:8686/">PirateBox chatroom</a> you can enter your own text and even upload pictures, videos or sounds. Some keywords, phrases and photos from the <a href="http://secretschool/tw.html">wiki</a> are also sent to the chatroom when clicked, and also trigger the presentation of associated sounds, images and texts.  This is the first version of this work, and many more interactions are planned.  All material entered will be kept as the suitcase travels between venues.  The idea is to create a collective text from the interactions of the viewers with this machine.
