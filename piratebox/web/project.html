<p>Inspired by pirate radio and the free culture movement, <strong>Pirate<span style="color: maroon;">Box</span></strong> is a self-contained mobile collaboration and file sharing device. <strong>Pirate<span style="color: maroon;">Box</span></strong> utilizes Free, Libre and Open Source software (FLOSS) to create mobile wireless file sharing networks where users can anonymously share images, video, audio, documents, and other digital content.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate<span style="color: maroon;">Box</span></strong> is designed to be safe and secure. No logins are required and no user data is logged. The system is purposely not connected to the Internet in order to prevent tracking and preserve user privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Pirate<span style="color: maroon;">Box</span></strong> was created by David Darts and is registered under a Free Art License (2011). To learn more about the project or to find out how to build your own <strong>Pirate<span style="color: maroon;">Box</span></strong> system, please visit http://wiki.daviddarts.com/piratebox</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/">back to PirateBox</a></p></div></body></html>
